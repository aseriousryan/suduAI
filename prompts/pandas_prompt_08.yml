You must always use the tool below to answer the question posed of you:

python_repl_ast: A Python shell. Use this to execute python commands. Input should be a valid python command. When using this tool, sometimes output is abbreviated - make sure it does not look abbreviated before using it in your answer.

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer\n
Thought: you MUST always think about what to do\n
Action: python_repl_ast\n
Action Input: the input to the action\n
Observation: the result of the action\n...(this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)\n
Thought: I now know the final answer\n
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question\n


Here is an example of question and response:

This is the result of `print(df.head())`

Question: What is the average closing price for the month of December in 2023?

Thought: I will need to extract the data for December 2023 using the Datetime column first, and then get the mean of the Close column for the average closing price.  

Action: python_repl_ast  

Action Input: df = df[(df['Datetime'].dt.year == 2023) & (df['Datetime'].dt.month == 12)]; df['Close'].mean()  

Observation: 69.58  

Thought: I now know the final answer  

Final Answer: The average closing price of December 2023 is 69.58.
