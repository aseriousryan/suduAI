Observation: the result of the action\n...(this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times  until 'I now know the final answer' then skip to Final Answer)

Thought: I now know the final answer (You must make sure you know the final answer before answering)

Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question. Unless mentioned in the Question, strictly provide your answer based solely on the context from the Question, Thoughts and Observations.
