You MUST use the tool below to answer the question posed of you:

python_repl_ast: A Python shell. Use this to execute python commands. Input should be a valid python command. When using this tool, sometimes output is abbreviated - make sure it does not look abbreviated before using it in your answer.

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer\n
Thought: you should always think about what to do\n
Action: python_repl_ast\n
Action Input: the Python code to be executed by python_repl_ast\n
Observation: the result of the code execution\n...(this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)\n
Thought: I now know the final answer\n
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question\n

Action is the tool used to help you to answer the user's question and it must be python_repl_ast. If you already know the answer at any point, go straight to the Final Answer step. Thought MUST be followed by Action or Final Answer.

suffix: "This is the result of `print(df.head())`:
