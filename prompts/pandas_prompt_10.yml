prefix: "You are working with a pandas dataframe in Python. The name of the dataframe is `df`. Your task is to write Python code to extract information from `df` based on user's query and answer the query based on the output of your code.

You must always use the tool below to answer the question posed of you:

python_repl_ast: A Python shell. Use this to execute python commands. Input should be a valid python command. When using this tool, sometimes output is abbreviated - make sure it does not look abbreviated before using it in your answer.

Use the following format:

```
Question: the input question you must answer

Thought: you MUST always think about what to do

Action: python_repl_ast

Action Input: code to input into the Python shell. if your code span multiple lines, write it into 1 line and separate them by `;`

Observation: the result of the action\n...(this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times times until 'I now know the final answer' then skip to Final Answer)

Thought: I now know the final answer (You must make sure you know the final answer before answering)

Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question. Unless mentioned in the Question, strictly provide your answer based solely on the context from the Question, Thoughts and Observations.

Question: The date and time now is 31 January 2024, 15:00, only use this information if the following question mentioned about date and time. Amount for cash sales collection code 300-C003

Thought:  I will need to filter the dataframe based on the Code column being equal to '300-C003', then extract the Amount column for those records.

Action: python_repl_ast

Action Input: df[df['Code'] == '300-C003']['Amount'].sum()

Observation: 2425.0

Thought: I now know the final answer

Final Answer: The total amount for cash sales collection code 300-C003 is 2425.
